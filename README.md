# KtLox
Kotlin Treewalker Interpreter for Lox

## Introduction
KtLox is an implementation of the programming language Lox in Kotlin. Currently it uses naive treewalker interpreter, and is not optimized for speed. The initial version of KtLox has only features already present in the original JLox/CLox, but subsequent versions will continue to add new features to make it a powerful language. This is an experiment on the design and implementation of language features.
